  <i class="text"> 
     This recipe is probably very easy to make because I can make it myself even if I don't know how I made it because the process is so quick that it just happens in the snap of a finger or with the blink of an eye and you start to feel the taste of it as you see it and you get hipnotized with its flavour because it is something that you have made yourself for the first time in your life and now you will often have the urge to make it again and again and again, not only to taste it but to feel the accomplishment of making a dish which is so easy that you don't even realized you have made it untill its already finished.

 <strong class="title"><em>Instruction -  </em></strong><br>
<p ><i class="text">Pour one glass into pan and empty the masala packet into the water(i mean pan) and then wait 10 secs, meanwhile do some dance steps. Be ready to do some action and crush your maggi packet with a hammer(or your hands) and put into the pan(the noodles, not the packet). <em> Wait sometime and meanwhile, make a video of yourself dancing and upload here which is necessary, without it, the recipe will not taste that special and remember that dance has to be monkey style. </em> Jokes aside, stir the maggi again and again from time to time and again to again from time to time. Does that make any sense? Oh wait. Your maggi is ready. See yourself and feel it deep within your eyes(or nose whatever). Enjoy. </i></p>
